# Interpreter-Experiment
This is the project of an experiment which focus on the difference between normal interpreter and JIT interpreter.

# Experiment
This is an experiment aim to make research on JIT interpreter.

We use a simple formula interpreter as subject to implement a normal and JIT interpreter respectively and 
compare their operating efficiency.
